 * the same code: the block registry, the inventory and the entity host functions name no client
 * class. What a server cannot inherit is the pair of handles, the screen and the player snap, and
 * those are all this replaces. The client-only functions are inherited and not overridden: each one
 * refuses itself through {@code ModLoaderAdapter.refuseWithoutAClient}, which turns a screenshot
 * test on a server into an err naming the function instead of an error from inside {@code
 * net.minecraft.client}. {@code useBlockForTest} is not one of them and is overridden: a click is
 * not a client-only function, so the server right-clicks in its own world, the world the test reads
 * (#1090).
 *
 * <p>A dedicated server has no {@code MinecraftInstance}, so the world comes from the one the
 * server run saw tick ({@link GrugServerRun#world()}), and the players are that world's.
